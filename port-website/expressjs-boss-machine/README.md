# Boss Machine

## This program uses GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE html heads to display, add, modify, or delete data in the application.

**Based on JavaScript, this program was used to exercise the ability to set routes using Express.JS framework**

**Front-end, test, and most parts of back-end files were provided by CodeCademy**

**The lines that were added by me are from 11 to 91 in the server.js file in the root of the project, and the file /server/checkMillionDollarIdea.js**
